# sharepoint_vue

## Description
This was built with using SharePoint 2013 lists in mind. I imported a list of Pokemon and their stats into a SharePoint list and created a SharePoint library for all the images of the Pokemon. The charts use Chart.js. A json file is used when developing outside the SharePoint environment for easier development.
